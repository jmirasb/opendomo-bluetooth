opendomo-bluetooth
===============

opendomo-bluetooth provides a bluetooth support for [OpenDomoOS2](http://es.opendomo.org).

More features will be discussed in the [Issues section](https://github.com/jmirasb/opendomo-bluetooth/issues) of this project.

How to test it?
===============

This plugin is not yet in a stable version, so it's required to be installed via oddevel package. To do so, install oddevel to your OpenDomoOS2 system, and execute the following lines as "admin", from the command line:

    $ plugin_add_from_gh.sh jmirasb opendomo-bluetooth 
    
After a few seconds the plugin will be ready in your system. Please, report any problem found in the [Issues section](https://github.com/jmirasb/opendomo-bluetooth/issues).
